A predecessor to Mesonis, this framework for space based games features faster ships, floaty physics, colourful stars, vibrant engine exhausts, and fast-paced gameplay.

The classic game of tag, but in space! A random ship spawns with a bomb. The ship with the bomb, known as the tagship, must seek out another spaceship to crash into to get rid of the bomb. Fortunately, the tagship has increased stats: better acceleration and turning rate. Here, the player's ship in pink has the bomb. A timer is displayed at the side to indicate how much time is left before the bomb goes off. Arrows appear in a circular radius indicating to the player where the nearest ships are, the size of each arrow changes depending on how close the other ships are.
